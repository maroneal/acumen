Let's number each different example separelty.  The numbers are there
mainly for ordering, not for grouping.  Each example should have a
different name independent of the number that it starts with.

When one example is similar to the revious one, the naming should be
similar and the difference should be highlighted in the comments.  In
addition, each example should contain a single line comment that makes
sense when you look at the examples in sequence.  That single line
comment should provide "the moral behind presenting this example".
For the Zeno example, that single line comment should answer the
question "Why does the graph for this example look like this".

In a sequence, it is best to progress from worst-performing to best
performing, where the point of bad behavior is to illustrate a real
problem that we solve.  (So, always avoid superflous problems, because
you don't people to say that you are solving that kind).

Finally, it would be good to tweak the parameters of all examples so
that they can run as fast as possible.  This is important to avoid
giving the impression that our approach is not too slow.
